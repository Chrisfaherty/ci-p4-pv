## About

The main focus of the Password Vault is to help users live a more secure life owhile online. This is accomplished by the password manager and blog with its security posts.

This password manager allows the user to sign up and store their account details. It then allows that users to view, add and edit their account details. It also allows users to read our monthly security blogs where we will be posting a blog about a n important security topic each month.

With the pace of everything going digital and everyone having different accounts for everything, its human nature to take the easy route and use the same password for every account. This has a huge impact on your security and shows why password managers are vital today more than ever.

### User Manual
<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

#### Welcome
On the welcome screen the project logo is displayed and it explains that this is a personal password manager.
The first thing you have to do is input your name in the field and press enter.

#### Main
After entering your name in the welcome screen you are greeted. The next step is to create your account assuming this is the first time using this password manager. 
To create an account type "create account" into the prompt window. It is importing to have the space in between create and account.

#### Create account
The first thing you have to do is create a user name and press enter. Next you have to create a password. The program displays the password criteria. 
The password must be longer than 8 characters, it must contain at least 1 uppercase and lowercase character, it must have at least one number and include one of the following special characters "@$_". This is to ensure you create a strong password. Once the password is created and you press enter it will let you know if the password was correct and stored. 
It will also give a reminder that only one user is stored as it is your personal password manager so you have to remember your login details and keep them safe.
Note: Make sure to write down your user name and password exactly or you will not be able to log into the password manager if you forget them.

#### Login function
After creating your account you are returned to the main screen. This gives you 2 options to create an account or to log in. By this point your account should be created so you can login.
Type login into the prompt. To login you will first be asked to enter your user name that you created for your master account. Once you enter your username it will ask you to enter your password.
Once you enter your password and press enter it will say your logged in if everything was correct and take you to the login function screen. 
The login function screen is where you get to choose what to do next. View your passwords, add a new website, edit your passwords, edit your master password & exit to the main screen.
If this is your first time in the password manager you should go to option 2 first and add a few websites you want to store the passwords for.

#### Adding a website
After you entered 2 into the prompt the program began the process to add a new website. The first thing you are asked to do is enter the website you want to store a password for and press enter. 
Now type in your username for that account and press enter. Now you create a password for this account. The password criteria is displayed, once the password is created press enter. 
If everything is ok it will display valid password and that the password manager updated sucessfully. Then you are returned to the login function screen.
You can repeat these steps a couple of times to enter all your websites.
Note: You can't enter the same website twice or it will give an error. The best thing to do is to add a number to the end of the website if you want to add a few accounts for the same website (facebook, facebook1, facebook2, ....).

#### Viewing passwords
After adding your passwords you will be able to view them by entering 1 in the login function screen where you have options 1 - 5.
Once you hit enter the program will pull all your stored passwords and display them on the screen for you. 
It then returns you back to the login function.

#### Editing passwords
You can also edit your passwords if you enter 3 in the login function screen. 
The first thing you are asked is to enter the website for the password you want to edit.
If the website you entered is stored in the system it will then ask you to enter a new password.
Once the new password is created and it meets the password criteria it will let you know if the password was updated and return you to the login function screen.

#### Editing the master password
To edit your master password you need to enter 4 at the login function screen.
The program will ask you to enter your name "This is not your username".
After your name is accepted it will ask you to enter a new password.
If your password meets the criteria it will display a message saying password updated.
You will then be returned to the login function screen.

#### Exit 
Once you are finished in your password manager you gan enter 5 in the login function screen. This will return you to the main screen.

## Technologies Used

### Languages
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) The language used for the logic of the project.

### Framework and Tools
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) Used for version control to push the code to GitHub.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) Used as a repository to store the projects code.
* [lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) Used to create the project flow.
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-console/) Used to manage access and permissions Google auth & sheets to google services.
* [Google Sheets](https://www.google.co.uk/sheets/about/) Used to store the passwords.
* [Heroku Platform](https://www.heroku.com) Used to deploy the project.

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries
* [Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html) - Used to delay the user input after the welcome message is displayed.
* [PrettyPrinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) - Used pprint to display the passwords in a organised format for option 1.
* [Pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) - Used to check Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP 8.

#### Third Party Libraries
* [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) JUSTIFICATION: Colorama was used add color to the Welcome message. It was also used to help the user notice if something was sucessful with green and an error with red.
* [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/) JUSTIFICATION: I used gspread to add and manipulate data in my Google spreadsheet and to interact with Google APIs. This was required to store the passwords and user details and edit them.
* [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) JUSTIFICATION: Used to set up the authentification needed to access the Google API and connect my Service Account with the Credentials function. A creds.json file was created with all details the API needs to access the google account.

## Testing

* Testing was condicted in three ways.
    * Testing the code with the pycodestyle extension.
    * Testing the code manually with the user stories.
    * Testing the password validation code with unit testing.

### Validator Testing
* pycodestyle
    * No errors were found when passing the site pages through the [pycodestyle validator](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)
    * Warnings were noted in the run.py file with the logo. This was due to the code thinking it was an excape sequance when using slashed.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs
* When editing the master password if you entered the user name instead of the name it would print the new password in the incorrect cell.
    * FIX: Change the function to focus on the one cell as this cell will not change.
* When locating the specific row and column for edit password the function would break if the coordinates where past row 9.
    * FIX: An if else statement was added so the formula changes once the cell is past row 9.
* When adding websites you could add the same one a few times but then to change the password it would change the first one it found.
    * FIX: A function was created to search for that website before adding a new one to the spread sheet. If there was one in the sheet already it would give a prompt to change the name so it is different to what is currently stored.
* When trying to edit a password that is not in the google sheet it would say dose not exsist but also triger the password updated print.
    * FIX: Moved the "password updated" from the main function to the edit password function.
